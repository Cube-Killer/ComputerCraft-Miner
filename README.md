# ComputerCraft-Miner
Mining program with Depth-first search in ComputerCraft

# Features
- Get all the minerals you can see in the mine road, and fill the air blocks with any block you want after digging mineral blocks
- Report the positions of special things (such as diamond ores, mob spawners, nether fortresses, abandoned mine shafts) to the host computer
- Place torches in the mine road
- Fill fluid blocks with any block you want
- Simple but useful functions (err, I mean functions like "`function()`")

# Requirement
## Mod version
v1.64 or above

## Things in your map
- **(RECOMMEND)** A GPS cluster ([How to build a GPS cluster?][1])  
  GPS clusters can help the miner to get its coordinates, so that **you do not need to input the coordinates or direction before going mining**. They are very **useful**.
- **(RECOMMEND)** A wireless receiving computer

## Things in/on your mining turtle
- A wireless modem
- Fuels
- Blocks to fill with
  The miner will fill the space with “Blocks to fill with” after digging the minerals.

# Usage
## Installation
Open your turtle.
If your mod version is 1.77 or above, then please use this command:
```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cube-Killer/ComputerCraft-Miner/master/Miner.lua miner
```  
If it's not, please use the following command in lua mode:  
```lua
io.open("miner", "a");io.output("miner");io.write(http.get("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cube-Killer/ComputerCraft-Miner/master/Miner.lua miner").readAll());io.close()
```

## Usage
Place the mining turtle with this program, and then start this program by inputing “miner”  

# Personalization
You may set your own settings. Just edit the following things:
```lua
--REPLACE YOUR OWN SETTINGS HERE
distance = 32
fillingblock = "minecraft:cobblestone"
--REPLACE YOUR OWN SETTINGS HERE
```
They're all in the top of the program. And they're my recommend.
